 * NOTE: Checkout is a way to move back and forward in your code history. The git checkout command serves three distinct functions: checking out files, checking out commits, and checking out branches.
 * NOTE: git checkout works hand-in-hand with git branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a branch with git branch, then check it out with git checkout. You can work on multiple features in a single repository by switching between them with git checkout
 * NOTE: To create a new branch adn start using it: "git branch new-feature" then "git checkout new-feature"
 * NOTE: git checkout <commit> <file> (checks out a spessific file from a spessific commit)

Since fetched content is represented as a remote branch, it has absolutely no effect on your local development work. This makes fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with your local repository.
 * NOTE: The git fetch command downloads commits from a remote repository into your local repo, does not download the actual files

 * branch
 * NOTE: to delete a branch do: "git branch -d some-branch" (if you just merged the branch in, if not use -D)
 * NOTE: to delete a branch from a remote repo: "git push origin --delete some_branch" Delete the specified branch. This is a ï¿½safeï¿½ operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.
 * NOTE: you can check which branches you have open by doing "git branch"
 * NOTE: Remote branches are just like local branches, except they represent commits from somebody elseï¿½s repository. You can check out a remote branch just like a local one, but this puts you in a detached HEAD state (just like checking out an old commit). You can think of them as read-only branches. 
 * NOTE: you can inspect these branches with the usual git checkout and git log commands. If you approve the changes a remote branch contains, you can merge it into a local branch with a normal git merge.
 * NOTE: git branch -r
 * # origin/master
 * # origin/develop
 * # origin/some-feature
 * NOTE: git checkout -b new_branch_name_here (Create and check out <new-branch>. The -b option is a convenience flag that tells Git to run git branch <new-branch> before running )

(*
 * Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again
 * NOTE: If the two branches youï¿½re trying to merge both changed the same part of the same file, Git wonï¿½t be able to figure out which version to use. When such a situation occurs, it stops right before the merge commit so 
 * NOTE: Note that merge conflicts will only occur in the event of a 3-way merge. Itï¿½s not possible to have conflicting changes in a fast-forward merge.
 * NOTE: The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. 
 * NOTE: to list all local branches in your repo do: "git branch"
 * NOTE: to list all remote branches in your repo do: "git branch -r"
 * NOTE: "git branch -D branch_name_here" Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.
 * NOTE: "git merge --no-ff branch_name_here" Merge the specified branch into the current branch, but always generate a merge commit (even if it was a fast-forward merge). This is useful for documenting all merges that occur in your repository.
 * NOTE: "git merge branch_name_here" Merge the specified branch into the current branch. Git will determine the merge algorithm automatically (discussed below).
 * NOTE: To merge a branch into another branch: first switch to the branch you want to merge into by doing "git checkout master", then do "git merge some_branch"
 * NOTE: To check out and merge a branch inn one-line: "git merge target_branch new_branch" (aka: target_branch <-- new_branch)
 * NOTE: To merge a remote branch into your local branch do: "git fetch origin master", "git checkout master", "git merge origin/master", if you get conflicts and you just want to keep all your or their updates you do "git checkout --thiers *" or "git checkout --ours *" and then add and commit and push. Now you have merged perfectly
 * @param from_branch the branch you want to apply to the @param into_branch
 * @param into_branch is the branch you usually checkout before doing the merge

(*
 * rebase
 * NOTE: it seems rebasing is almost the same as merging, but with rebasing you also get the opertunity to squash commits into fewer commits, so when the rebasing is complete, the commit history looks will look simpler than with merging.
 * NOTE: The golden rule of git rebase is to never use it on public branches.
 * NOTE: One of the best ways to incorporate rebasing into your workflow is to clean up local, in-progress features. By periodically performing an interactive rebase, you can make sure each commit in your feature is focused and meaningful. This lets you write your code without worrying about breaking it up into isolated commitsï¿½you can fix it up after the fact.
 * NOTE: you can also squash together commits without merging: "git checkout feature" then "git rebase -i HEAD~3" By specifying HEAD~3 as the new base, youï¿½re not actually moving the branchï¿½youï¿½re just interactively re-writing the 3 commits that follow it. Note that this will not incorporate upstream changes into the feature branch.
 * NOTE: If you would prefer a clean, linear history free of unnecessary merge commits, you should reach for git rebase instead of git merge when integrating changes from another branch.
 * NOTE: you switch to the branch you want to rebase and then do "git rebase master"
 * TODO: try "git rebase -i" see if it works as a commit squassher

 * stash
 * NOTE: plain old `git stash` won't touch files that are untracked. For this, you need to use `git stash -u`
 * NOTE: stash vs branch merge: branch merge creates an extra commit, use stash when your in the middle of some unfinished feature and you need to pause it where it is
 * NOTE: stash vs branch rebase: the jury is still out, need more research into rebase, but it could resolve the extra commit problem
 * NOTE: use names for each stash: git stash save Major refactor of foo before interruption
 * NOTE: apply stash: git stash apply stash@{1}
 * NOTE: applies the latest stash and removes it: git stash pop
 * NOTE: remove stashes: stash drop stash@{1}
 * NOTE: list all stashes: git stash list
 * NOTE: stash also removes all files in your directory as if you just did a "git reset --hard"
 * NOTE: when you apply your stash again, you may get file conflicts, resolve this as you would resolve a branch merge
 * TODO: test if you can use theirs and ours as you would in a regular merge
