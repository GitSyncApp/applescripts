 * NOTE: to delete a branch from a remote repo: "git push origin --delete some_branch" Delete the specified branch. This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.
 * NOTE: you can check which branches you have open by doing "git branch"
 * NOTE: Remote branches are just like local branches, except they represent commits from somebody else’s repository. You can check out a remote branch just like a local one, but this puts you in a detached HEAD state (just like checking out an old commit). You can think of them as read-only branches. 
 * NOTE: you can inspect these branches with the usual git checkout and git log commands. If you approve the changes a remote branch contains, you can merge it into a local branch with a normal git merge.
 * NOTE: git branch -r
 * # origin/master

 * Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again
 * NOTE: If the two branches you‘re trying to merge both changed the same part of the same file, Git won’t be able to figure out which version to use. When such a situation occurs, it stops right before the merge commit so 
 * NOTE: Note that merge conflicts will only occur in the event of a 3-way merge. It’s not possible to have conflicting changes in a fast-forward merge.
 * NOTE: The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. 
 * NOTE: to list all local branches in your repo do: "git branch"
 * NOTE: to list all remote branches in your repo do: "git branch -r"
 * NOTE: "git branch -D branch_name_here" Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.
 * NOTE: "git merge --no-ff branch_name_here" Merge the specified branch into the current branch, but always generate a merge commit (even if it was a fast-forward merge). This is useful for documenting all merges that occur in your repository.
 * NOTE: "git merge branch_name_here" Merge the specified branch into the current branch. Git will determine the merge algorithm automatically (discussed below).
 * NOTE: To merge a branch into another branch: first switch to the branch you want to merge into by doing "git checkout master", then do "git merge some_branch"
 * NOTE: To check out and merge a branch inn one-line: "git merge target_branch new_branch" (aka: target_branch <-- new_branch)
 * NOTE: To merge a remote branch into your local branch do: "git fetch origin master", "git checkout master", "git merge origin/master", if you get conflicts and you just want to keep all your or their updates you do "git checkout --thiers *" or "git checkout --ours *" and then add and commit and push.

(*
 * rebase
 * NOTE: it seems rebasing is almost the same as merging, but with rebasing you also get the opertunity to squash commits into fewer commits, so when the rebasing is complete, the commit history looks will look simpler than with merging.
 * NOTE: The golden rule of git rebase is to never use it on public branches.
 * NOTE: One of the best ways to incorporate rebasing into your workflow is to clean up local, in-progress features. By periodically performing an interactive rebase, you can make sure each commit in your feature is focused and meaningful. This lets you write your code without worrying about breaking it up into isolated commits—you can fix it up after the fact.
 * NOTE: you can also squash together commits without merging: "git checkout feature" then "git rebase -i HEAD~3" By specifying HEAD~3 as the new base, you’re not actually moving the branch—you’re just interactively re-writing the 3 commits that follow it. Note that this will not incorporate upstream changes into the feature branch.
 * NOTE: If you would prefer a clean, linear history free of unnecessary merge commits, you should reach for git rebase instead of git merge when integrating changes from another branch.
 * NOTE: you switch to the branch you want to rebase and then do "git rebase master"
